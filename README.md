### 📌 About Me
Hi, I'm Pierre. 🚀 From Parisian agencies 🗼 to founding startups 🌆, I've grown as a full-stack developer.

With vast experience and proficiency in JavaScript & React.js, I'm eager to re-engage as a lead senior developer, always focusing on projects where teamwork 🤝 and innovation 💡 take the front seat.

### 💭 Interesting Fact:
One fun fact outside of work? I'm deeply 📖 fascinated by literature, psychology, and philosophy. I've had a few personal rendezvous with the mystical – some might even say I have a hint of a psychic touch. But don't worry, I promise to only use my powers for good... and maybe to predict the next big JavaScript framework! 🔮
