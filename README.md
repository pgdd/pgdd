### 💭 Interesting Fact:
One fun fact outside of work? I'm deeply 📖 fascinated by literature, psychology, and philosophy. I've had a few personal rendezvous with the mystical – some might even say I have a hint of a psychic touch. But don't worry, I promise to only use my powers for good... and maybe to predict the next big JavaScript framework! 🔮
